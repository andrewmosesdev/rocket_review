## Description:
Rocket Review is a full-stack MERN application designed to improve the process of face-to-face review in the virtual classroom. Users can create, read, update, and remove review items which are broken down by difficulty, topic, and subtopic. This automates the process of preparing review items and ensures that all users are getting the same, most up-to-date information in their review items.
